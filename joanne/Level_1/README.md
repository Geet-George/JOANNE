Level-1 includes all files processed by ASPEN from Level-0. ASPEN takes in D-type files as input, and gives an output of QC-ed files. For JOANNE, the D_P files were supplied as input to BatchASPEN v3.4.3, and thus all Level-1 files have the suffix _PQC. The files are all in the NetCDF (.nc) format.

A detailed explanation of the file-structure of these *_PQC.nc files is given [here](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/system/files/NCAR_EOL_ISF_dropsonde_NetCDF_data_files_4.pdf) and the QC checks carried out by ASPEN are outlined in detail [here.](https://ncar.github.io/aspendocs/pdf/aspendocs.pdf) The configuration used for the current version is editsonde, but this will change to research-dropsonde in future versions.
