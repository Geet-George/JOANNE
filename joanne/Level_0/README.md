 Level-0 includes the raw files generated by [AVAPS](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/observing_facilities/avaps-dropsonde-system) - the aircraft dropsonde system for HALO and P3 - during dropsonde measurements. For every dropsonde launch, there are multiple files generated, which are responsible for storing either different information or similar information in a different format. These files are as follows:

 |<div>FILE TYPE</div>    | <div style="width:290px">DESCRIPTION</div>                                                                                                                                                                          |
 | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | <nobr> **R Files** </nobr>   | Receiver ports data: signal strength and receiver frequency                                                                                                                               |
 | <nobr> **D Files** </nobr>   | Raw sounding data recorded for every 0.25 s timestamp                                                                                                                                     |
 | <nobr> **D_P Files** </nobr> | Only post-launch raw data; same as D-Files                                                                                                                                                |
 | <nobr> **A Files** </nobr>   | Sounding attributes file; includes channel configuration, COM ports data, hardware configuration, launch obs data, sensor errors, aircraft data, software config and firmware information |
 | <nobr> **B Files** </nobr>   | File containing binary data; same as D-Files                                                                                                                                              |
 | <nobr> **C Files** </nobr>   | Sounding data stored in CSV format                                                                                                                                                        |

In addition to these files, there are files generated per flight, which give information about the hardware and the data that is input from the aircraft itself. These are stored as single files per flight. This is on the assumption, that the AVAPS system was switched on only once per flight. If for any reason, the AVAPS system was switched off and on multiple times, there will be as many instances of these files. The files are as follows:

| FILE TYPE                             | DESCRIPTION                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <nobr> **0_SysLog Files** </nobr>     | CSV file of all AVAPS system logs                                                           |
| <nobr> **1_Aircraft Files** </nobr>   | TXT file of aircraft position data in the IWGADTS Format (IWG1)                             |
| <nobr> **2_GPSRef Files** </nobr>     | TXT file of GPS data: GPGGA (system fix data) and GPRMC (minimum specific GPS/Transit data) |
| <nobr> **3_SpecAnlyzr Files** </nobr> | TXT file of logs of spectral analyzer                                                       |

All AVAPS raw files of a single day (as per UTC) are stored in a single directory with its name in the format YYYYMMDD. For JOANNE, all Level-0 files are stored in their respective date directories. The P3 and HALO directories are separated into two different directories named after the respective aircrafts.
