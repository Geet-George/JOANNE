Precipitable water is computed before the interpolation of the soundings is carried out. Values of precipitable water is from measurements on the raw grid.

What should be the pressure level at upto which integration for PW is carried out? For now, no limit is specified. Thus, PW value is upto top of measured profile.

Static stability is estimated using method by Bluestein (1992).

For all estimations of saturated vapour pressure, method by Hardy (1998) was used.
