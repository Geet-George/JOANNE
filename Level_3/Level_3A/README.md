<h4>Launch Time</h4>

Level-3A data are of the trajectory type with a single timestamp associated with each sounding, i.e. the launch time. The sounding does not have time at all levels, because for the original sounding, time is the independent variable, and interpolating that does not make sense. If it is essential for the user to obtain time for the relevant levels here, the data are still available in the Level-1 files, and thus, can still be retrieved. It would not be recommended though, to use "time of recording" in conjunction with interpolated variables.

Precipitable water is computed before the interpolation of the soundings is carried out. Values of precipitable water is from measurements on the raw grid.

What should be the pressure level at upto which integration for PW is carried out? For now, no limit is specified. Thus, PW value is upto top of measured profile.

Static stability is estimated using method by Bluestein (1992).

For all estimations of saturated vapour pressure, method by Hardy (1998) was used.
